# Chimichangas

Chimichangas is a species of artificially simulated beings created as part of Project DC. This repository holds a simulation environment created in pygame which is to be used with Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to find out the evolution of Chimichangas.

## DDPG Model

This branch uses DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients) algorithm which is an Actor-Critic reinforcement learning algorithm on the chimichangas environment.
